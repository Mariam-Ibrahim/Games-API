        <p class="text-white" id="myParagraph">DC Universe Online (DCUO) is a free-to-play, comics based MMORPG developed by Daybreak Game Company (formerly Sony Online Entertainment.) Start your adventure by creating your very own superhero or villain, complete with various superpowers, and then team up with iconic DC Comic characters like Batman, The Joker, and others to complete your “training” as a new resident of this hero infested world. While DCUO sports many traditional MMORPG systems, the game also has a more unique interface specifically designed for an MMO that spans both PC and console platforms, and one that lends itself very well to controller play. PvE content is explored primarily through the use of story episodes, raids, Duo instances, and Iconic Battles. Following the game’s DLC story additions, DCUO allows players to fly, sprint, and brawl their way through memorable locations such as Gotham City, Metropolis, and others all while assisting well known DC Universe characters throughout the DLC story. DCUO is a free-to-play title, but additional DLC does come at a cost for those that do not opt for the monthly subscription fee. These additional content items (episodes) can be purchased individually as can additional character slots and other in-game items. On the PvP side of content, DCUO provides two primary PvP options: Arenas and Legends. Matches come in the 1v1, 2v2, 4v4, 5v5, and 8v8 variety. Legends PvP allows players to assume the role of pre-balanced iconic DC characters regardless of the player’s actual character level or faction affiliation. This mode is a nice way for players to farm PvP currency without having to wait until they level but some heroes and villains are locked and require either a cash purchase or unlocking with PvP currency. Arenas are the more standard PvP option allowing players to take their individual characters into the fray. Open world PvP is available provided that the player has entered a PvP server. DCUO is available on PC and the Playstation 4 and Playstation 3 gaming consoles.</p>
